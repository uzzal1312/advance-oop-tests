# Lab Test One: Full-Stack CRUD Application

**Course:** Advanced Object-Oriented Programming  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Total Marks:** 10

---

## 📋 Overview

In this lab test, you will create a full-stack application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **your own creative idea**. The application consists of:

1. **GitHub Codespaces Configuration** - Automated development environment setup
2. **Frontend** - React with TypeScript for the user interface
3. **Backend** - Spring Boot REST API for data management

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab test, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Configure a complete development environment using GitHub Codespaces
- Build a React TypeScript frontend application
- Implement a Spring Boot REST API with full CRUD operations
- Integrate frontend and backend components
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles

---

## 📝 Requirements

### Part 1: GitHub Codespaces Configuration

Configure the development environment to automatically set up all required tools and dependencies.

**Deliverables:**
- Development environment configuration that installs all necessary tools
- Environment ready to run both frontend and backend applications

---

### Part 2: Backend - Spring Boot REST API

Create a backend application with REST API endpoints.

**Deliverables:**
- REST API with the following HTTP methods:
  - GET (retrieve all resources)
  - GET (retrieve single resource by ID)
  - POST (create new resource)
  - PUT (update entire resource)
  - PATCH (partially update resource)
  - DELETE (remove resource)
- All endpoints must be functional

---

### Part 3: Frontend - React TypeScript Application

Create a frontend application with user interface.

**Deliverables:**
- User interface displaying all resources
- Form for creating and updating resources
- Functionality to delete resources
- Complete integration with backend API
